Design and Assumptions

I went with a barebones design in the sense of I attempted to make it as lean as possible.

I assumed this program will see no use other than a demonstration of my aptitude for the position. As such I did not take into account different input formats. Such as changing the program to use city names instead of ABCD or E.

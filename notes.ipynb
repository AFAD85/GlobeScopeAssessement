    "Enclosed is a programming problem. We ask that you read the description thoroughly then create a simple program to solve the problem.\n",
    "For the solution, we request that you use (in no particular order) Javascript (e.g. TypeScript, React),PHP (e.g. Symfony) or Python as a base for your application. You may use 3th party libraries or tools for building or testing purposes.\n",

    "\n",
    "- create 1 or more classes that can be used to execute your program;\n",

    "Jest, Python or any other framework). You should provide sufficient evidence that your solution is\n",

    "Problem:  The local commuter railroad services a number of towns.  Because of monetary concerns,\n",
    "all of the tracks are one-way. That is, a route from A to B does not imply the existence of a route from\n",
    "B to A. In fact, even if both of these routes do happen to exist, they are distinct and are not necessarily\n",
    "the same distance!\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this problem is to help the railroad provide its customers with information about the\n",
    "routes. In particular, you will compute the distance along a certain route, the number of different routes\n",
    "between two towns, and the shortest route between two towns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: A directed graph where a node represents a town and an edge represents a route between two\n",
    "towns. The weighting of the edge represents the distance between the two towns. A given route will\n",
    "never appear more than once, and for a given route, the starting and ending town will not be the same\n",
    "town.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: For test input 1 through 5, if no such route exists, output NO SUCH ROUTE. Otherwise,\n",
    "follow the route as given; do not make any extra stops!  For example, the first problem means to start\n",
    "at city A, then travel directly to city B (a distance of 5), then directly to city C (a distance of 4).\n",

    "6. The number of trips starting at C and ending at C with a maximum of 3 stops. In the sample\n",
    "data below, there are two such trips: C-D-C (2 stops). and C-E-B-C (3 stops).\n",
    "7. The number of trips starting at A and ending at C with exactly 4 stops. In the sample data\n",
    "below, there are three such trips: A to C (via B,C,D); A to C (via D,C,D); and A to C (via\n",
    "D,E,B).\n",
    "8. The length of the shortest route (in terms of distance to travel) from A to C.\n",
    "9. The length of the shortest route (in terms of distance to travel) from B to B.\n",
    "10. The number of different routes from C to C with a distance of less than 30. In the sample data,\n",
    "the trips are: CDC, CEBC, CEBCDC, CDCEBC, CDEBC, CEBCEBC, CEBCEBCEBC.\n",
